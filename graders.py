    """
    Grade agent performance on a task.
    Returns score between 0.0 and 1.0.

    Formula:  0.5 * recall  +  0.3 * precision  +  0.2 * severity_match

    Rationale:
      - Recall (0.5): finding real bugs is the primary objective.
        Missing a critical security issue is worse than a false alarm.
      - Precision (0.3): false positives waste developer time; penalise them
        but less than misses.
      - Severity match (0.2): correct classification helps triage; bonus signal.

    Line matching uses ±2 tolerance to handle LLM off-by-one errors.
